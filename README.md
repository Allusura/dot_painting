#Description:
# A simple program I made after 19 days of studying.

# The point of the program is to take an image inputted by
# the user and extract a pre-defined number of colors
# from the image (10 (-2 I removed myself) in this program)
# into a list and then make a new "art piece" known as a
# dot painting, printing the dots in a sequence of a 10x10 shape
# with randomly chosen colors from the list we made from an image we provided.
